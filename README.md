# Growing my Game
* This is meant to be both a personal challenge and a way to showcase my knowledge I learned during my C# and Unity journey.
  * The idea behind the game is that I would start with no game idea and try and add features and grow the game concept as the game evolves. This is similar to a particular writing style by some authors where they don't fully plan the book but have general ideas of main events.
   The authors may change their minds about the events and change the story direction completely if they wanted to. I want to do the same thing with my game.
  * I aim to finish a game with most functionalities, like UI, Goals, Game Systems, all implemented and work with to errors. The original goal was to finish the game within four days, but since I couldn't do that I extended the deadline to a week.
